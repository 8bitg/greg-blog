Jekyll is super interesting!  
  
Today I learned that the **/gh-pages branch** will be pushed to live as soon as it is updated in *Github*.  
  
This means that basically all work can be done in **/gh-pages** and I can run `$ jekyll serve` to run it locally and then push out the changes once I am satisfied.  
  
This is not an *optimal* workflow, but it will definitely get the job done, in the *short-term*.
